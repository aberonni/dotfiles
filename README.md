# [aberonni](https://github.com/aberonni)â€™s dotfiles

These are the dotfiles that I use, started as a fork of [canemacchina](https://github.com/canemacchina)'s dotfiles and mixed with a bit of [Mulder90](https://github.com/mulder90)'s dotfiles.

## Setup

To set up the `dotfiles` just run the appropriate snippet in the terminal:

(:warning: **DO NOT** run the `setup` snippet if you don't fully understand [what it does](setup.sh). Seriously, **DON'T**!)

`bash -c "$(curl -LsS https://raw.github.com/aberonni/dotfiles/master/setup.sh)"`

That's it! :sparkles:

## Backup

Run `setup.sh -b`
